# v3.0

First of all, many background fixes, most players won't notice. Furthermore, you can't use abilities as spectator anymore.
This update also includes some improvements, e.g. the lag when pressing "V" is fixed and some related issues, too.
If a player is riding a player transformed as horse, the horse-players sees the riding player that the correct position.
There are many metadata-fixes and improvements, too. For example, you need the CraftedCore, Architectury API, Minecraft and Modloader version, Woodwalkrs was developed with. (It crashed before, now it shows you that you're using outdated dependencies.)
Now, just something I personally wanted; Spiders can climb Cobwebs from now on.
But, I've laso improved many more animations, like the fox animations or the bat resting animation.
Moreover, I added a brand-new mechanic for server owner, modder and everyone interested; existing **Abilities can now be registered for EntityTypes via Datapacks** and what I'm really proud of is a new mechanic to **register mob variants via datapacks**. A Guide will soon be published in the [wiki](https://github.com/ToCraft/woodwalkers-mod/wiki).
Now, let's get to the latest stuff. The cat sitting animation doesn't look that glitched anymore (it's another one now) and slimes don't hurt other slimes, but you can hurt nearby players as a slime!
Dolphins also imply Dolphin's Grace on the nearest swimming player, so you can swin with your friends.
There is also a new variant for Snow Golems, where there Pumpkin is taken off.
Finally, striders start shaking and turn purple if they're outside of lava.
