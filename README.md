# Woodwalkers

*Woodwalkers* is a mod lore-wise based on the book [Woodwalkers](https://www.katja-brandis.de/2016/05/11/woodwalkers/), and technically-based on [Identity](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/identity).

**Become your favourite mob!**

This mod allows you to choose a second shape, you can transform into at any time you want by just pressing a key!

Walk over lava as a strider, discovery the caves as a bat or let your foes base explode as a ghast!
**Nearly every mob has some nice abilities!**

Even your hearts and your size will be changed to the one of the mob and your nametag will stop rendering, so no one could tell which one is the mob and which one is the player! Trick your friends!

## Getting Started

Open the menu to select your second shape by pressing the MENU_KEY (by default ' ^ '). You can switch your shape by pressing the TRANSFORM_KEY (by default 'G'). Choose carefully! This choice is forever! Once chosen, you can't change it again! (But still, there's an OP-command and a config-option to reset your second shape after death...) 

## How can I support this project?

I'm always happy about someone who translates this mod to other languages or tells me about bugs/issues.
Everyone who supplies a concept, bug-fix, translation or generally helps a lot with dev-work will get a new texture as wolf which is enabled by sneaking while pressing the MENU_KEY.
